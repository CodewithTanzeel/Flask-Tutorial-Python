## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodewithTanzeel/Flask-Tutorial-Python.git
cd Flask-Tutorial-Python
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, you can create one by listing the necessary packages, such as:

```
Flask==2.0.1
```

Then, run the installation command again.

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Configure the environment variables needed for the Flask application:

```bash
# On Windows:
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development

# On macOS and Linux:
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

### 5. Initialize the Database

If the application uses a database, initialize it:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
```

Ensure that the necessary configurations are set in your application for database connections.

### 6. Run the Application

Start the Flask development server:

```bash
flask run
```

Access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
